O proud left foot, that ventures quick within 
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe. 
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin: 
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe. 
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke, 
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl. 
To spin! A wilde release from Heavens yoke. 
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl. 
The Hoke, the poke - banish now thy doubt 
Verily, I say, 'tis what it's all about.  -  by "William Shakespeare"
