Security professionals have said for years that the only way to make a
computer truly secure is for it to not be connected to any other computers, a
method called airgapping. Then, any attack would have to happen physically,
with the attacker actually entering the room and accessing the computer that
way, which is incredibly unlikely. In the case of computers containing highly
sensitive information, additional, physical security can always be added in
the form of security guards, cameras, and so on.
Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have uncovered a vulnerability
in all computers, however, which can be exploited regardless of an air gap.
It’s a vulnerability which you’d never suspect, and it’s one that’s hard to
fight against. All CPUs emit electromagnetic signals when they are performing
tasks, and the first thing these researchers discovered was that binary
ones and zeroes emit different levels. The second thing they discovered is
that electromagnetic radiation is also emitted by the voltage fluctuations
and that it can be read from up to six meters away. These signals, by the
way, are known as side-channels, and they are well-documented in the
cryptography field.
