Valencia Course Offerings
Valencia College course offerings and descriptions are
grouped under the applicable department heading. Within the
alphabetized department headings, courses are listed alphabetically
by subject prefix.
A prerequisite is a course which must be completed satisfactorily
before a higher-level related course can be taken. A corequisite
is a course which must be taken at the same time as another course.
Prerequisites and corequisites are denoted within each course
description. At the time of registration in a course, all students, except
transient students with official documentation, are subject to the
current course corequisites and prerequisites, some of which require
minimum entry test scores.
Valencia awards semester credits. The following is a guide to the
abbreviations at the top of the pages with course descriptions. There
may be exceptions to these guidelines.
College-Level and Developmental Credits
Cr Credits per term
Cls Class hours per week (full term)
Lab Lab hours per week (full term)
Vocational Credits:
Con Contact hours per course
The following is a guide to the letters attached to the end of course
numbers:
C represents a combined classroom and
laboratory experience
H represents the Honors version of a course
L represents a laboratory experience
N represents a supplemental tutorial
A course may have the designation of “multiple credit course” in the
course description. This means that the course can be repeated for
credit; a repeat will not count as an attempt for full cost of instruction
or for withdrawal; and grade forgiveness cannot be applied.
Not all courses are offered in all terms or at all campuses. For current
offerings, consult the listing of credit courses available prior to
registration each term at valenciacollege.edu/students/courses.asp.
When a course is added to Valencia’s curriculum, it must be assigned a
course number by the Statewide Course Numbering System. Until the
course number is assigned, Valencia uses a temporary designator
composed of an “N” followed by three digits; e.g., N004.
At times, the course number for a particular course has to be changed.
When this occurs and the content of the course is determined to be
the same, the two course numbers represent equivalent courses. In the
course descriptions that follow, numbers for former equivalent courses
are provided for the majority of courses for which there is a former
equivalent.
The preceding pages include a listing of the majority of former courses
that have current equivalencies.
