# cs-coursework
Collection of my computer science coursework at the University of Central Florida. Work is organized by course number which is described below. 

* CDA3103 - Computer Logic and Organization
	* Introduce fundamentals of the organization and design of computers from both the computer programmer's perspective and computer ''architect's'' perspective. This folder includes the MySpim project which is a MIPS processor simulator written in C.  

* CIS3360 - Security In Computing
	* Security in computing is concerned with protecting the information, the systems and hardware that use, store and transmit that information.  This folder includes implementations of the Hill Cipher and CRC algorithm written in C.  

* COP2800 - Object Oriented Programming I (Java)
	* An introduction to OO in Java.  

* COP2805 - Object Oriented Programming II (Java)
	* A continuation of COP2800 that focuses on intermediate topics in Java such as exceptions, threads, and MVC.  

* COP3402 - System Software (Compilers)
	* This course is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of real and virtual machines as language processor and the implementation of compilers. This folder includes a the PL0 which is a compiler simulator written in C. 

* COP3502 - Computer Science I (Data Structures)
	* Course on problem solving techniques, order analysis and notation, abstract data types, and recursion. This folder includes implementations of linked lists and binary trees in C.  

* COP3503 - Computer Science II (Algorithms)  
	* Intermediate to advanced level course on algorithm design and analysis. Folder includes Java programs implementing various algorithms such as MiniMax, Huffman Compression, and Dynamic Programming.  

* COP4020 - Programming Languages (Haskell/Prolog)
	* A course on functional and logical programming in Haskell and prolog.  

* COP4516 - Team Dynamics (Programming Contests)
	* A course that is similar to training UCF's programming contest. Covers algorithms and problem solving skills to solve programming contest problems. The first half of the courses has weekly programming contest in a free for all format while the second half of the course has a weekly programming contest in a team format.  

* COP4600 - Operating Systems
	* A course covering the concepts of OS structure, process mangement, process scheduling, virtual memory, and I/O.  

* COT4210 - Discrete Structures II (Theory of Computation)
	* This course examines different models of computation and determines their computational ability. This folder includes Java implemenations of DFA minimization, checking for valid CNF context free grammars, and Turing machines.
